    ">### Definition of a Derivative\n",
    ">The derivative of a function at a specific point gives us the slope of the tangent line to the curve of that function at that point. It measures how the function's output changes as its input changes.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Mathematically, the derivative of a function $f(x)$ at point $x=a$ is defined as:\\\n",
    ">$$f'(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$$\\\n",
    ">Here's what each part of this definition means:\n",
    ">* $h$: This represents a small change in the input value  $x$\n",
    ">* $f(a+h)-f(a)$: This is the change in the output of the function when the input changes by $h$\n",
    ">* $\\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$: This quotient represents the average rate of change of the function over the interval $[a, a + h]$\n",
    ">* $\\lim_{h \\to 0}$: The limit as $h$ approaches 0 gives us the instantaneous rate of change, which is the derivative at the point $x=a$\n",
    ">### Intuitive Interpretation\n",
    ">**Slope of the Tangent Line**: The derivative $f'(a)$ is the slope of the line tangent to the graph of the function at the point $x=a$. The tangent line just \"touches\" the curve at that point, and its slope gives us the best linear approximation of the function near that point.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Rate of Change**: The derivative measures how rapidly the function's output changes with respect to a small change in the input. If $f'(a)$ is positive, the function is increasing at $x = a$; if $f'(a)$ is negative, the function is decreasing. If $f'(a)=0$, the function has a horizontal tangent at that point, indicating a possible local maximum or minimum.\n",
    ">### Geometric Interpretation\n",
    ">**Secant Lines**: Initially, the expression $\\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}$ represents the slope of a secant line, which intersects the curve at two points: $x=a$ and $x=a+h$.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Tangent Line**: As $h$ approaches 0, the secant line gets closer and closer to the tangent line at $x=a$. The slope of this tangent line, as $h$ becomes infinitesimally small, is the derivative $f'(a)$.\n",
    ">### Algebraic Interpretation\n",
    ">**Difference Quotient**: The expression $\\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}$ is called the difference quotient. It gives the average rate of change of the function over the interval from $a$ to $a+h$. The limit process hones in on the exact rate of change at $x=a$.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Derivative as a Function**: The derivative $f'(x)$ can be viewed as a new function derived from $f(x)$. This new function tells you the slope of the original function at any point $x$.\n",
